locopy Roadmap
--------------

At this current time ``locopy`` is in a stable state. We are planning on continuing to 
add features and functionality as the community of users asks for them, but there are no 
pressing issues which we are looking to add in immediately.

There are some longer term issues which are open for people to work on, and a more nice to have, but we have not gotten 
feedback from the community if they are critical or pressing:

- Add Postgres support `#28 <https://github.com/capitalone/locopy/issues/28>`_
- Azure Snowflake  `#32 <https://github.com/capitalone/locopy/issues/32>`_
- Support for non-Delimited file types in Redshift `#39 <https://github.com/capitalone/locopy/issues/39>`_
